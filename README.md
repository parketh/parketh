# Hi there, I'm Park ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack and smart contract developer, currently exploring the StarkNet ecosystem and zero knowledge applications in web3. I have a diverse background across engineering ([Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)), data science and finance ([Google](https://github.com/google)), product management (at a VC-backed fintech startup), and venture capital ([Fabric Ventures](fabric.vc), the leading web3 VC in Europe). 

## ðŸ˜„ About me 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about ZK applications and building in the web3 space.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on novel ideas in web3, upcoming hackathons, particularly in StarkNet and other Layer 2 ecosystems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @parkyeuth on Telegram, @park_eth on LinkedIn, or by email [yeungparkhay@gmail.com](mailto:yeungparkhay@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Hong Kong, and I used to be a speedcuber.
