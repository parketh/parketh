## Hi there, I'm Park 👋🏽

I am a DeFi protocol engineer blending institutional finance expertise with deep experience in building audited systems across EVM, Starknet, Solana and Bitcoin. 

I'm currently building [GitFish](https://github.com/gitfishdev), a funding platform for open source projects. 

——

**Other projects and libraries:**

- [Haiko](https://github.com/haiko-xyz): an advanced AMM with algorithmic LP strategies on Starknet, audited by [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits) and [Nethermind](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind)
  
- [Babylon](https://github.com/babylonlabs-io/babylon): built OP-stack L2 integration for their trustless Bitcoin staking primitive

- [Private Money](https://github.com/parketh/pm-core): a modern, gas-optimized fork of Tornado Cash enabling private transfers on Base (or any EVM chain)
  
- [Napa](https://github.com/parketh/napa): toy implementation of an on-chain options order book protocol written in Cairo and deployed as a Madara app-chain to explore the Madara stack

- [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-protocol/sphinx-core): natively cross-chain and composable CLOB DEX deployed on Starknet for trustless settlement and liquidity composition, powered by storage and SNARK proofs (1st place win at Starknet Encode Autumn Hackathon)

- [Switch](https://github.com/switch-recover/switch) (ex: Starknet Recovery Service): first fully trustless and on-chain wallet recovery service for Ethereum EOAs, powered by SNARKs and storage proofs (1st place win at 2022 Starknet House Hackathon)

- [cairo-data-structures](https://github.com/parketh/cairo-data-structures): Cairo 0 library of common data structures (e.g. binary trees, heaps and linked lists) optimised for fast execution, read / write capability and on-chain storage
 
- [scaffold-stark](https://github.com/parketh/scaffold-stark): forkable Starknet dev stack focused on rapid contract iterations and reusable frontends, inspired by scaffold-eth (2nd place win at 2022 ethCC hackathon)
