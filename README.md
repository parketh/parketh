# Hi there, I'm Park

I'm a web3 founder and full stack + smart contract developer. I've previously worked at companies like [Google](https://github.com/google) and [Fabric Ventures](https://github.com/fabric-ventures).

I'm currently building [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-dex), a novel AMM for launching, trading and earning tokens on Starknet.
