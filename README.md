# Hi there, I'm Park ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack and smart contract developer, currently exploring the StarkNet ecosystem and zero knowledge applications. I have a diverse background across engineering ([Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)), data science ([Google](https://github.com/google)), product management (earnr, a VC-backed fintech startup), and venture capital ([Fabric Ventures](fabric.vc)). 

## ðŸ˜„ About me 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about ZK applications and building in the web3 space.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on novel ideas in web3, upcoming hackathons, particularly in StarkNet and other Layer 2 ecosystems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @parkyeuth on Telegram, @park_eth on LinkedIn, or by email [yeungparkhay@gmail.com](mailto:yeungparkhay@gmail.com)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Hong Kong, and I used to be a speedcuber.

## ðŸ’» Projects

[scaffold-stark](https://github.com/parketh/scaffold-stark): A forkable StarkNet developer stack focused on fast product iterations and reusable frontends, inspired by scaffold-eth. **Won second place at 2022 ethCC StarkNet hackathon**.

[Switch](https://github.com/Starknet-Recovery-Service) (ex: StarkNet Recovery Service): The first fully trustless and on-chain wallet recovery service for Ethereum Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), powered by storage proofs on StarkNet. **Won first place at the 2022 Starknet House Hackathon**.

[cairo-ds](https://github.com/parketh/cairo-data-structures): Cairo library of common data structures (e.g. binary trees, heaps and linked lists) optimised for fast execution, read / write capability and on-chain storage. 

[Envoy](https://github.com/parketh/envoy): A governance platform for decentralised delegate teams to more effectively manage their on-chain governance. I'm currently using this tool to better manage the governance team at LBS Blockchain.
