# Hi there, I'm Park 👋

I am a full stack and smart contract developer, currently building DeFi and infrastructure tooling for the [StarkNet](https://starknet.io/what-is-starknet/) ecosystem. I spend most of my time building software and learning about zero knowledge proofs, blockchain scaling, and programming in Solidity, Cairo, and Rust.

Prior to retraining as a software developer, I interned as a financial data analyst at Google and worked on fundraising and technical research at [Fabric Ventures](http://fabric.vc), a European web3 VC. Before that, I was a CFA-qualified financial analyst focusing on asset valuation in the context of international arbitration.

I am also studying for an MBA at London Business School. There, I lead on-chain governance as part of [LBS Blockchain](https://lbs-blockchain.com/) and manage our delegation at [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/). 

## 😄 About me 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about ZK applications and novel technology solutions for blockchain scaling.
- 🤝 Open to collaborations, knowledge sharing and idea exchange with other web3 builders.
- 📫 How to reach me: @parkyeuth on Telegram, @park_eth on Twitter, or by email [yeungparkhay@gmail.com](mailto:yeungparkhay@gmail.com).
- 🖊️ I also publish a web3 blog called [Open Source Finance](http://opensourceweb.substack.com/), which tries to make web3 concepts easy to understand for non-web3 natives.

## 💻 Projects

[Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-dex): A native cross-chain Order Book Decentralised Exchange (DEX), built on StarkNet. **Won first place at 2022 Encode StarkNet Autumn hackathon**.

[Switch](https://github.com/switch-recover/switch) (ex: StarkNet Recovery Service): The first fully trustless and on-chain wallet recovery service for Ethereum Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), powered by storage proofs on StarkNet. **Won first place at the 2022 Starknet House Hackathon**.

[scaffold-stark](https://github.com/parketh/scaffold-stark): A forkable StarkNet developer stack focused on fast product iterations and reusable frontends, inspired by scaffold-eth. **Won second place at 2022 ethCC StarkNet hackathon**.

[cairo-data-structures](https://github.com/parketh/cairo-data-structures): Cairo library of common data structures (e.g. binary trees, heaps and linked lists) optimised for fast execution, read / write capability and on-chain storage. 

[Envoy](https://github.com/parketh/envoy): A governance platform for decentralised delegate teams to more effectively manage their on-chain governance. I'm currently using this tool to better manage the governance team at LBS Blockchain.
